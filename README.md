# mspa_fullscreen

Makes flashes and iframes in MSPA, Newgrounds, Kongregate, and Miniclip have a fullscreen button next to them that will make them fill the screen. Works almost every time with MSPA, but is less reliable on the other sites. Many flashes will refuse to expand, others will expand but then break in subtle ways.

Be very careful about fullscreening a flash with the same aspect ratio as your screen; if the flash captures your keyboard it can be very difficult to leave fullscreen mode and you may need to kill your browser.
